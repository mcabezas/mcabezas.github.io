Global Hackathon - Jenkins Pipelines Orchestration project

Today was an amazing day, my team has received the prize for our participation
at J.P.Morgan Global Hackathon. We achieved the second place!!

I would like to say thank you all, beyond doing software we had built some more.
We have built moments and it was one of my best moments working here.
I will keep it into my memories forever because I love what I do and I love it more when I have the opportunity to share my passion with people who love it as well.

Building software is the best.
